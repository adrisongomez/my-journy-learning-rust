# My journey learning Rust

## Overview

This is a repo to recording all my learning and keynote during my expirence learning rust.

My reference is the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) offer on the [Rust official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and also their [learning interactive website](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)

Every chapter on the books has indepent directory on the root on top level of the repo and sections or code exercise has independent directory on chapter directory. Every chapter directory has a README.md with my all keynotes and codes examples, and within I added some usefull comments.
