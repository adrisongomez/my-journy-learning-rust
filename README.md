# My journey learning Rust

## Overview

This is a repo to recording all my learning and keynote during my experience learning rust.

My reference is the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) offered on the [Rust official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and also their [learning interactive website](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)

Every chapter on the books has an independent directory on the root on the top level of the repo and sections or code exercise has an independent directory on the chapter directory. Every chapter directory has a README.md with my all keynotes and codes examples, and within I added some useful comments.
note chapter 2 on this repo is chapter 3 of the book.
